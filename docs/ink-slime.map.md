# Ink Slime: Map of Maps

**Version**: v1.0.0  
**Created**: 2025-06-20  
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Owner**: Game Development Team  

## Overview

This document serves as the central directory for all Ink Slime game documentation, including software development maps and AI agent guide files. It provides a structured overview of the game's architecture, components, and systems to help developers, designers, and AI agents understand and navigate the codebase.

## Architecture/Design

The Ink Slime game is built using a component-based entity system with a state-driven game loop. The architecture follows a modular design pattern, separating game logic, rendering, input handling, and state management.

```

## Key Components

### Game Engine

The core game engine coordinates all subsystems and manages the main game loop. It handles initialization, updates, rendering, and cleanup of game resources.

**Map File**: [Game Engine Map](../docs/engine/game-engine.map.md)

### Entity System

The entity system manages game objects using a component-based architecture. Entities are composed of various components that define their behavior, appearance, and properties.

**Map File**: [Entity System Map](../docs/entities/entity-system.map.md)

### State Management

The state management system handles different game states (main menu, gameplay, pause, game over) and transitions between them.

**Map File**: [State Management Map](../docs/states/state-management.map.md)

### Level System

The level system manages level generation, progression, and completion criteria.

**Map File**: [Level System Map](../docs/levels/level-system.map.md)

### UI System

The UI system handles user interface elements, including menus, buttons, labels, and HUD elements.

## Data Flow

The data flow in Ink Slime follows a typical game loop pattern, with input processing, state updates, physics calculations, and rendering.

```mermaid

    participant GameEngine as Game Engine
    participant StateManager as State Manager
    participant EntityManager as Entity Manager
    participant Physics as Physics Engine
    participant Renderer as Renderer
    
    loop Game Loop
        Input->>GameEngine: Process Input
        GameEngine->>StateManager: Update Current State
        StateManager->>EntityManager: Update Entities
        EntityManager->>Physics: Calculate Physics
        Physics->>EntityManager: Apply Physics Results
        GameEngine->>Renderer: Render Frame
    end
```

## API/Interface Definitions

### Game Engine API
